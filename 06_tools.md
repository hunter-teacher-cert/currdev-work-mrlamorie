### Tool  #1 - <br>
#### Type: Programming  Tool<br>
_Name:_ [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) <br>

_General purpose:_  OGDB is a relatively full-featured online IDE, with debugger, compiler and all the goodies, including remote project storage and login, and itâ€™s free. A description from them: <br>

> GDB online is an online compiler and debugger tool for C, C++, Python, PHP, Ruby, C#, VB, Perl, Swift, Prolog, Javascript, Pascal, HTML, CSS, JS Code, Compile, Run and Debug online from anywhere in the world.


_Classes used in:_ Computer Science<br>

_How it is used:_ As primary code editor, debuger, and compiler<br>

_Why was it selected?:_ Because it solved 2 problems at the same time - getting an editor on every machine without having to wait for IT to do it, and because IT had blocked Git, and while it does not do all the things that Git allowed, it did address one key functionality, remote saving of files so that students could work on their code on multiple devices.

### Tool #2 - <br>
#### Type: Monitoring Tool <br>
_Name:_ GoGuardian <br>

_General purpose:_  GoGuardian is at its core a way of monitoring student use of School Chromebooks (and, as I understand of late, other devices as well). It does this by allowing you to monitor in real time, lock devices, set up classes with recurring schedules, and control student web browsing by either creating a white list or a black list. <br>



_Classes used in:_ I use GoGuardian in all my classes <br>

_How it is used:_ Per its intended use. I have a general whitelist scheme for each class, and I sometimes restrict it beyond that or open it up more for individual use cases.
<br>

_Why was it selected?:_ While there are some other tools out there for the same general purpose, GoGuardian was one of the first, and as such, my school adopted it early on. Now they have a site license for all teachers and, as such, I use what is paid for. <br>
